# FIP#1 Initial Group FLAG distribution

### Summary
The communityâ€™s first vote will be on token allocation to the Flamincome Project Team.

### Specification
This is a special proposal for there will be four votes totally but the votes are in the same format and work for the same function so we describe them all in this file. 
Each vote will decide whether to distribute 6.25% additional FLAG tokens. The range will be 0%~25%. 
Once the issue is approved, the amount will increase by 6.25% each time until the community rejects the proposal

### For
For each vote in the four votes, allocate 6.25% of FLAG to Flamincome Project Team.

### Against
To avoid from giving too much administration authority to the Flamincome Project Team, you can choose `NO` and the team will not receive any tokens.
